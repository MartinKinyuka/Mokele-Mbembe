  <p>My little lizard is known as the Mokele-Mbembe. She originates from the rivers of the Congo basin and is close relatives with the Loch Ness Monster of Scotland. Distant relatives include apatosaurus and the thunder lizard itself Brontosaurus.</p>
  <p>Although she is huge in size, she is a big softie and is a strict vegan. her favourite snacks are melons and her favourite toy is any suitable log she can find in her pond.
